# Redis CLI

## About it

redis-cli is the Redis command line interface, a simple program that allows to send commands to Redis, and read the replies sent by the server, directly from the terminal.

It has two main modes: 
* an interactive mode where there is a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) where the user types commands and get replies; 
* and another mode where the command is sent as arguments of redis-cli, executed, and printed on the standard output.
