Each of the following solutions has been proven to be effective and We hope to be helpful to you.

## Domain binding

The precondition for binding a domain is that Redis can accessed by domain name.

Nonetheless, from the perspective of server security and subsequent maintenance considerations, the **Domain Binding** step cannot be omitted.

Redis domain name binding steps:

1. Use **SFTP** to connect your Cloud Server
2. Modify [Nginx configuration file](/stack-components.md#nginx), change the **server_name**'s value *localhost* to your domain name
   ```text
   ...
      server_name    localhost; # Change to a your domain name
   ...
   ```
3. Save it and restart [Nginx Service](/admin-services.md#nginx)
   ```
   sudo docker restart nginx
   ```
